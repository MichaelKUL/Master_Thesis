	abstract = {After covering control-flow discovery in depth in Part {III}, this chapter looks at the situation in which both a process model and an event log are given. The model may have been constructed by hand or may have been discovered. Moreover, the model may be normative or descriptive. Conformance checking relates events in the event log to activities in the process model and compares both. The goal is to find commonalities and discrepancies between the modeled behavior and the observed behavior. Conformance checking is relevant for business alignment and auditing. For example, the event log can be replayed on top of the process model to find undesirable deviations suggesting fraud or inefficiencies. Moreover, conformance checking techniques can also be used for measuring the performance of process discovery algorithms and to repair models that are not aligned well with reality.},

	abstract = {Monitoring the compliance of the execution of multi-party business processes is a complex and challenging task: each actor only has the visibility of the portion of the process under its direct control, and the physical objects that belong to a party are often manipulated by other parties. Because of that, there is no guarantee that the process will be executed — and the objects be manipulated — as previously agreed by the parties. The problem is usually addressed through a centralized monitoring entity that collects information, sent by the involved parties, on when activities are executed and the artifacts are altered. This paper aims to tackle the problem in a different and innovative way: it proposes a decentralized solution based on the switch from control- to artifact-based monitoring, where the physical objects can monitor their own conditions and the activities in which they participate. To do so, the Internet of Things ({IoT}) paradigm is exploited by equipping physical objects with sensing hardware and software, turning them into smart objects. To instruct these smart objects, an approach to translate classical Business Process Model and Notation ({BPMN}) process models into a set of artifact-centric process models, rendered in Extended-{GSM} (E-{GSM}) (our extension of the Guard-Stage-Milestone ({GSM}) notation), is proposed. The paper presents the approach, based on model-based transformation, demonstrates its soundness and correctness, and introduces a prototype monitoring platform to assess and experiment the proposed solution. A simple case study in the domain of advanced logistics is used throughout the paper to exemplify the different parts of the proposal.},

When discovering a process model from event logs, it is assumed that the process at the beginning of the recorded period is the same as the process at the end of the recorded period. Obviously, this is often not the case due to the phenomenon known as concept drift. While cases are being handled, the process itself may be changing. This paper presents an approach to analyze such second-order dynamics. The approach has been implemented in {ProM} and evaluated by analyzing an evolving process.},

However, process models tend to be dynamic due to various factors, which has brought challenges such as change point detection, change localization and change process discovery. Existing techniques to identify change points are sensitive to parameters and the accuracy is not satisfactory. This paper proposes a novel approach to deal with such concept drift phenomenon. Event logs can be characterized by the relationships between activities, which motivates us to transform a log into a relation matrix. By detecting the always and never intervals in each row of the relation matrix, we obtain candidate change points for each relation. Finally, all the candidate change points are combined into an overall result. The approach is also able to localize the changes between different phases. Experiments on synthetic logs show that our approach is accurate and performs better than the state of the art in detecting sudden drift.},

Regarding manual activities, this data can be generated from sensor data acquired from the Internet of Things. The main objective of this paper is the development and evaluation of an approach which recognizes and logs manually performed activities, enabling the application of established process discovery methods. A system was implemented which uses a body area network, image data of the process environment and feedback from the executing workers in case of uncertainties during detection. Both feedback and image data are acquired and processed during process execution. In a case study in a laboratory environment, the system was evaluated using an example process. The implemented approach shows that the inclusion of image data of the environment and user feedback in ambiguous situations during recognition generate log data which well represent actual process behavior.},

Deviations in the process behavior during runtime can be detected from process event streams as so called concept drifts. Existing work has focused on concept drift detection so far, but has neglected why the drift occurred. To close this gap, this paper provides online algorithms to analyze the root cause for a concept drift using sensor event streams. These streams are typically gathered externally, i.e., separated from the process execution, and can be understood as time sequences. Supporting domain experts in assessing concept drifts through their root cause facilitates process optimization and evolution. The feasibility of the algorithms is shown based on a prototypical implementation. Moreover, the algorithms are evaluated based on a real-world data set from manufacturing.},

While specific combinations of {BPM} and {CEP} have attracted research attention, resulting in solutions to specific problems, we attempt to take a broad view at the opportunities and challenges involved. We first illustrate these by a detailed example from the logistics domain. We then propose a mapping of this area into four quadrants — - two quadrants drawing from {CEP} to create or extend process models and two quadrants starting from a process model to address how it can guide {CEP}. Existing literature is reviewed and specific challenges and opportunities are indicated for each of these quadrants. Based on this mapping, we identify challenges and opportunities that recur across quadrants and can be considered as the core issues of this combination. We suggest that addressing these issues in a generic manner would form a sound basis for future applications and advance this area significantly.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things ({IoT}) enables software-based access to vast amounts of data streams from sensors measuring physical and virtual properties of smart devices and their surroundings. While sophisticated means for the control and data analysis of single {IoT} devices exist, a more process-oriented view of {IoT} systems is often missing. Such a lack of process awareness hinders the development of process-based systems on top of {IoT} environments and the application of process mining techniques for process analysis and optimization in {IoT}. We propose a framework for the stepwise correlation and composition of raw {IoT} sensor streams with events and activities on a process level based on Complex Event Processing ({CEP}). From this correlation we derive refined process event logs-possibly with ambiguities-that can be used for process analysis at runtime (i. e., online). We discuss the framework using examples from a smart factory.},

However, in many cases, the event data generated during the execution of a process is at a much lower level of abstraction, e.g., sensor data. Hence, in this paper, we present a novel technique that allows us to translate sensor data into higher-level, discrete event data, thus enabling existing process mining techniques to work on data tracked at a sensory level. Our technique discretises the observed sensor data into activities by applying unsupervised learning in the form of clustering. Furthermore, we refine the observed sequences by deducing imperative sub-models for the observed discretised data, i.e., allowing us to identify concurrency and interleaving within the data. We evaluated the approach by comparing the obtained model quality for several clustering techniques on a publicly available data-set in a smart home scenario. Our results show that applying our framework combined with a clustering technique yields results on data that otherwise would not be suitable for process discovery.},

One of the important aspects of compliance checking is to ensure that business activities will be executed in a certain order. In a previous work, we have presented a formal approach for efficient compliance checking based on model checking technology. A limitation of that approach and of similar approaches is the lack of explanation about how violations could occur. In this paper we resolve this limitation by exploiting the notion of patterns/anti patterns. Execution ordering compliance rules are expressed as {BPMN}-Q queries. For each query a set of anti pattern queries is automatically derived and checked against process models as well. When a violation (an anti pattern) finds a match, the violating part of the process is shown to the user.},
